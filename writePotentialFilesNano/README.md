## Generate Potential Files

This folder contains the python files that generate the potential tables and the potential parameters for the DEM contact models LIGGGHTS-NANO

You only need to run *generatePotentialFiles.py*. At the beginning of the file, there you can define some parameters such as the involved diameters, filenames, humidity, damping coefficients and friction coefficients. Pleas note, that the friction coefficients are adjusted as described in the papers.
