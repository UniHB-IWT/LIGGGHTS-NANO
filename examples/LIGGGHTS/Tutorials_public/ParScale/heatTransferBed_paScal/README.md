Particle Bed with Intra-Particle Temperature Gradients
=======================================================
This example case demonstrates the use of a 1D continuum
model for a set of particles to predict the intra-particle 
temperature profile

How to run:
-----------

- Open a terminal at the `in.*` files and just type `./Allrun_convective`
- In case `Allrun_*` and `Allclean` are not executable, just type `chmod +x All*`
- After the simulation is done type `Allclean` to delete all generated files
- the script `genInput.m` can be used to generate ParScale input data for a larger number of particles
- The script `pascal/plotMe.m` is an input script for octave
