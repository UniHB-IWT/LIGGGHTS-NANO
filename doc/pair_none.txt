pair_style none command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style none :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style none :pre

[Description:]

Using a pair style of none means pair forces are not computed.

With this choice, the force cutoff is 0.0, which means that only atoms
within the neighbor skin distance (see the "neighbor"_neighbor.html
command) are communicated between processors.  You must insure the
skin distance is large enough to acquire atoms needed for computing
bonds, angles, etc.

A pair style of {none} will also prevent pairwise neighbor lists from
being built.  However if the "neighbor"_neighbor.html style is {bin},
data structures for binning are still allocated.  If the neighbor skin
distance is small, then these data structures can consume a large
amount of memory.  So you should either set the neighbor style to
{nsq} or set the skin distance to a larger value.

[Restrictions:] none
