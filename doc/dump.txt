[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of atom quantities to one or more files every N
timesteps in one of several styles.  The {image} style is the
exception; it creates a JPG or PPM image file of the atom
configuration every N timesteps, as discussed on the "dump
image"_dump_image.html doc page.  The timesteps on which dump output
is written can also be controlled by a variable; see the "dump_modify
every"_dump_modify.html command for details.

Only information for atoms in the specified group is dumped.  The
"dump_modify thresh and region"_dump_modify.html commands can also
alter what atoms are included.  Not all styles support all these
options; see details below.

As described below, the filename determines the kind of output (text
or binary or gzipped, one big file or one per timestep, one big file
or multiple smaller files).

IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Unless the "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify.html option
is invoked, the lines of atom information written to dump files
(typically one line per atom) will be in an indeterminate order for
each snapshot.  This is even true when running on a single processor,
if the "atom_modify sort"_atom_modify.html option is on, which it is
by default.  In this case atoms are re-ordered periodically during a
simulation, due to spatial sorting.  It is also true when running in
parallel, because data for a single snapshot is collected from
multiple processors, each of which owns a subset of the atoms.

For the {atom}, {custom}, and {local} styles, sorting is off by
default.  For the {xyz} style, sorting by
atom ID is on by default. See the "dump_modify"_dump_modify.html doc
page for details.

:line

The {style} keyword determines what atom quantities are written to the
file and in what format.  Settings made via the
"dump_modify"_dump_modify.html command can also alter the format of
individual values and the file itself.

The {atom}, {local}, and {custom} styles create files in a simple text
format that is self-explanatory when viewing a dump file.

For post-processing purposes the {atom}, {local}, and {custom} text
files are self-describing in the following sense.

The dimensions of the simulation box are included in each snapshot.
For an orthogonal simulation box this information is is formatted as:

ITEM: BOX BOUNDS xx yy zz
xlo xhi
ylo yhi
zlo zhi :pre

where xlo,xhi are the maximum extents of the simulation box in the
x-dimension, and similarly for y and z.  The "xx yy zz" represent 6
characters that encode the style of boundary for each of the 6
simulation box boundaries (xlo,xhi and ylo,yhi and zlo,zhi).  Each of
the 6 characters is either p = periodic, f = fixed, s = shrink wrap,
or m = shrink wrapped with a minimum value.  See the
"boundary"_boundary.html command for details.

For triclinic simulation boxes (non-orthogonal), an orthogonal
bounding box which encloses the triclinic simulation box is output,
along with the 3 tilt factors (xy, xz, yz) of the triclinic box,
formatted as follows:

ITEM: BOX BOUNDS xy xz yz xx yy zz
xlo_bound xhi_bound xy
ylo_bound yhi_bound xz
zlo_bound zhi_bound yz :pre

The presence of the text "xy xz yz" in the ITEM line indicates that
the 3 tilt factors will be included on each of the 3 following lines.
This bounding box is convenient for many visualization programs.  The
meaning of the 6 character flags for "xx yy zz" is the same as above.

Note that the first two numbers on each line are now xlo_bound instead
of xlo, etc, since they repesent a bounding box.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_7 of the doc pages for a geometric
description of triclinic boxes, as defined by LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC, simple formulas
for how the 6 bounding box extents (xlo_bound,xhi_bound,etc) are
calculated from the triclinic parameters, and how to transform those
parameters to and from other commonly used triclinic representations.

The "ITEM: ATOMS" line in each snapshot lists column descriptors for
the per-atom lines that follow.  For example, the descriptors would be
"id type xs ys zs" for the default {atom} style, and would be the atom
attributes you specify in the dump command for the {custom} style.

For style {atom}, atom coordinates are written to the file, along with
the atom ID and atom type.  By default, atom coords are written in a
scaled format (from 0 to 1).  I.e. an x value of 0.25 means the atom
is at a location 1/4 of the distance from xlo to xhi of the box
boundaries.  The format can be changed to unscaled coords via the
"dump_modify"_dump_modify.html settings.  Image flags can also be
added for each atom via dump_modify.

For style {atom/vtk}, atom coordinates, velocity, rotational
velocity, force, atom ID, atom radius and atom type are written to
VTK files. Note that you have to link against VTK libraries to use
this functionality.

Style {custom} allows you to specify a list of atom attributes to be
written to the dump file for each atom.  Possible attributes are
listed above and will appear in the order specified.  You cannot
specify a quantity that is not defined for a particular simulation -
such as {q} for atom style {bond}, since that atom style doesn't
assign charges.  Dumps occur at the very end of a timestep, so atom
attributes will include effects due to fixes that are applied during
the timestep.  An explanation of the possible dump custom attributes
is given below.

For style {local}, local output generated by "computes"_compute.html
and "fixes"_fix.html is used to generate lines of output that is
written to the dump file.  This local data is typically calculated by
each processor based on the atoms it owns, but there may be zero or
more entities per atom, e.g. a list of bond distances.  An explanation
of the possible dump local attributes is given below.  Note that by
using input from the "compute
property/local"_compute_property_local.html command with dump local,
it is possible to generate information on bonds that can
be cut and pasted directly into a data file read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html command.

The {xyz} style writes XYZ files, which is a simple text-based
coordinate format that many codes can read. Specifically it has
a line with the number of atoms, then a comment line that is
usually ignored followed by one line per atom with the atom type
and the x-, y-, and z-coordinate of that atom. You can use the
"dump_modify element"_dump_modify.html option to change the output
from using the (numerical) atom type to an element name (or some
other label). This will help many visualization programs to guess
bonds and colors.

The {mesh/stl} style dumps active STL geometries defined via
"fix mesh"_fix_mesh.html commands into the specified file.
If you do not supply the optional list of mesh IDs, all meshes are dumped,
irrespective of whether they are used in a "fix wall/gran"_fix_wall_gran.html
command or not. By specifying a list of mesh IDs you can explicitly
choose which meshes to dump. The group-ID is ignored, because the command
is not applied to particles, but to mesh geometries.
With keywords 'local', 'owned' or 'ghost' you can decide which parts
of the parallel meshes you want to dump (default is 'local'). If the
multiprocessor option is not used (no '%' in filename), data is gathered
from all processors, so using the default will output the whole mesh
data across all processors.

Examples:

dump stl1 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump*.stl
dump stl2 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump_proc%_local*.stl local
dump stl3 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump_proc%_ghost*.stl ghost
dump stl4 all mesh/stl 300 post/dump_proc_all_ghost*.stl ghost :pre

The first command will write one file per time-step containing the complete
mesh. The second command will output one file per time-step per processor
containing the local (owned) mesh elements of each processor.
The third command will output one file per time-step per processor
containing the ghost (corona) mesh elements of each processor.
The third command will output one file per time-step containing the
ghost (corona) mesh elements of all processors.

With the {region} keyword, just those mesh element where the element center
(arithmetic average of all nodes) is in the specified region, will be
dumped.

This dump is especially useful if a
"fix move/mesh"_fix_move_mesh.html is registered. If the position
of the mesh is changed over time and you want to dump one file for each dump
timestep for post-processing together with the particle data, you should use
a filename like 'mydumpfile*.stl'. Note: This series of files can then be
post-processed together with the particle dump file converted to VTK in
Paraview , www.paraview.org

By providing any ID (or a list of IDs) of "fix mesh/surface"_fix_mesh_surface.html
commands, you can specify which meshes to dump. If no meshes are specified,
all meshes used in the simulation are dumped.

The {mesh/vtk} or the {mesh/vtm} (new) style can be used to dump active mesh
geometries defined via "fix mesh"_fix_mesh.html commands to a series of VTK
files. The {mesh/vtk} style allows the file endings .vtk, .vtp and .pvtp. The
first two write the data only on one processor, the latter writes several files
in parallel. The {mesh/vtm} style currently only allows the .vtm file ending
and writes in serial only. Different keywords can be used to dump the
per-triangle averaged stress in normal and shear direction, id, velocity, wear,
stress components (fx / element area, fy / element area, fz / element area),
area (area of each element) or the process which owns the element
(visulatisation of the parallel decomposition) into the specified file using a
VTK file format. The 'meshes' keyword (only for {mesh/vtm}) and the list of
mesh IDs is optional.  As with the stl style, all active meshes are dumped if
you do not supply the optional list of mesh IDs. By specifying list of mesh IDs
you can explicitly choose which meshes to dump. The group-ID is ignored. Again,
a series of files can be post-processed in Paraview , www.paraview.org Most
keywords as used for the {mesh/vtk} style are self-explanatory. Keyword
{output} controls how the data is written. If {face} (default) is selected then
all point variables will be interpolated to the triangle faces. For the value
{interpolated} all cell values will be interpolated to the respective points
and finally for {original} no interpolation will take place and cell and point
variables are written to cells and points, respectively. Keywords {aedges} and
{acorners} dump the number of active edges/corners per face.  Keyword {nneighs}
dumps the number of face neighbors LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC has recognized for each face.

{mesh/vtm} is similar to {mesh/vtk} but only the arguments are different. The
former requires the use of the keyword {meshes} which has to be followed either
by a list of mesh-ids or the keyword 'all'. The latter will cause all meshes to
be dumped. After the mesh specification {mesh/vtm} can be provided with the
optional keyword {mesh_properties} that needs to be followed by the dump
identifiers. The list of such identifiers is identical to {mesh/vtk}.

By providing the 'meshes' keyword and any ID (or a list of IDs) of
"fix mesh/surface"_fix_mesh_surface.html commands, you can specify which meshes to dump.
If no meshes are specified, all meshes used in the simulation are dumped.

The {decomposition/vtk} style dumps the processor grid decomposition
into a series of VTK files. No further args are expected.

For all vkt outputs if {dump_modify binary} is used, the dump file (or files, if
"*" is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file will
be about the same size as a text version, but will typically write out much
faster. Additionally, {dump_modify compressor} can be used to specify the
writing of compressed binary data. Options for compressors include:

none: No compression
zlib: Zlib compression
lz4: Lz4 compression (VTK >= 8.0 required) :pre

:line

Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including
timestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if the
minimization converges.  Note that this means a dump will not be
performed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked,
if the current timestep is not a multiple of N.  This behavior can be
changed via the "dump_modify first"_dump_modify.html command, which
can also be useful if the dump command is invoked after a minimization
ended on an arbitrary timestep.  N can be changed between runs by
using the "dump_modify every"_dump_modify.html command.
The "dump_modify every"_dump_modify.html command
also allows a variable to be used to determine the sequence of
timesteps on which dump files are written.  In this mode a dump on the
first timestep of a run will also not be written unless the
"dump_modify first"_dump_modify.html command is used.

The specified filename determines how the dump file(s) is written.
The default is to write one large text file, which is opened when the
dump command is invoked and closed when an "undump"_undump.html
command is used or when LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC exits.

Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, tmp.dump.* becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.10000,
tmp.dump.20000, etc.  Note that the "dump_modify pad"_dump_modify.html
command can be used to insure all timestep numbers are the same length
(e.g. 00010), which can make it easier to read a series of dump files
in order with some post-processing tools.

If a "%" character appears in the filename, then each of P processors
writes a portion of the dump file, and the "%" character is replaced
with the processor ID from 0 to P-1.  For example, tmp.dump.% becomes
tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1, ... tmp.dump.P-1, etc.  This creates smaller
files and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines that
support parallel I/O for output. This option is not available for the
 {xyz} style.

By default, P = the number of processors meaning one file per
processor, but P can be set to a smaller value via the {nfile} or
{fileper} keywords of the "dump_modify"_dump_modify.html command.
These options can be the most efficient way of writing out dump files
when running on large numbers of processors.

Note that using the "*" and "%" characters together can produce a
large number of small dump files!

If the filename ends with ".bin", the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file
will be about the same size as a text version, but will typically
write out much faster.  This option is only
available for the {atom} and {custom} styles.

If the filename ends with ".gz", the dump file (or files, if "*" or "%"
is also used) is written in gzipped format.  A gzipped dump file will
be about 3x smaller than the text version, but will also take longer
to write.

:line

This section explains the local attributes that can be specified as
part of the {local} style.

The {index} attribute can be used to generate an index number from 1
to N for each line written into the dump file, where N is the total
number of local datums from all processors, or lines of output that
will appear in the snapshot.  Note that because data from different
processors depend on what atoms they currently own, and atoms migrate
between processor, there is no guarantee that the same index will be
used for the same info (e.g. a particular bond) in successive
snapshots.

The {c_ID} and {c_ID\[N\]} attributes allow local vectors or arrays
calculated by a "compute"_compute.html to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script.  See the
"compute"_compute.html command for details.  There are computes for
calculating local information such as indices, types, and energies for
bonds.

Note that computes which calculate global or per-atom quantities, as
opposed to local quantities, cannot be output in a dump local command.
Instead, global quantities can be output by the "thermo_style
custom"_thermo_style.html command, and per-atom quantities can be
output by the dump custom command.

If {c_ID} is used as a attribute, then the local vector calculated by
the compute is printed.  If {c_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length local
array calculated by the compute.

The {f_ID} and {f_ID\[N\]} attributes allow local vectors or arrays
calculated by a "fix"_fix.html to be output.  The ID in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been defined
previously in the input script.

If {f_ID} is used as a attribute, then the local vector calculated by
the fix is printed.  If {f_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length local
array calculated by the fix.

Here is an example of how to dump bond info for a system,
including the distance and energy of each bond:

compute 1 all property/local batom1 batom2 btype
compute 2 all bond/local dist eng
dump 1 all local 1000 tmp.dump index c_1\[1\] c_1\[2\] c_1\[3\] c_2\[1\] c_2\[2\] :pre

:line

This section explains the atom attributes that can be specified as
part of the {custom} and style.

The {id}, {mol}, {type}, {element}, {mass}, {vx}, {vy}, {vz}, {fx}, {fy},
{fz}, {q} attributes are self-explanatory.

{Id} is the atom ID.  {Mol} is the molecule ID, included in the data
file for molecular systems. {id_multisphere} is the ID of the multisphere
body that the particle belongs to (if your version supports multisphere). 
{Type} is the atom type.  {Element} is
typically the chemical name of an element, which you must assign to
each type via the "dump_modify element"_dump_modify.html command.
More generally, it can be any string you wish to associated with an
atom type.  {Mass} is the atom mass.  {Vx}, {vy}, {vz}, {fx}, {fy},
{fz}, and {q} are components of atom velocity and force and atomic
charge.

There are several options for outputting atom coordinates.  The {x},
{y}, {z} attributes write atom coordinates "unscaled", in the
appropriate distance "units"_units.html (Angstroms, sigma, etc).  Use
{xs}, {ys}, {zs} if you want the coordinates "scaled" to the box size,
so that each value is 0.0 to 1.0.  If the simulation box is triclinic
(tilted), then all atom coords will still be between 0.0 and 1.0.  Use
{xu}, {yu}, {zu} if you want the coordinates "unwrapped" by the image
flags for each atom.  Unwrapped means that if the atom has passed thru
a periodic boundary one or more times, the value is printed for what
the coordinate would be if it had not been wrapped back into the
periodic box.  Note that using {xu}, {yu}, {zu} means that the
coordinate values may be far outside the box bounds printed with the
snapshot.  Using {xsu}, {ysu}, {zsu} is similar to using {xu}, {yu}, {zu},
except that the unwrapped coordinates are scaled by the box size. Atoms
that have passed through a periodic boundary will have the corresponding
cooordinate increased or decreased by 1.0.

The image flags can be printed directly using the {ix}, {iy}, {iz}
attributes.  For periodic dimensions, they specify which image of the
simulation box the atom is considered to be in.  An image of 0 means
it is inside the box as defined.  A value of 2 means add 2 box lengths
to get the true value.  A value of -1 means subtract 1 box length to
get the true value.  LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC updates these flags as atoms cross
periodic boundaries during the simulation.

The {mux}, {muy}, {muz} attributes are specific to dipolar systems
defined with an atom style of {dipole}.  They give the orientation of
the atom's point dipole moment.  The {mu} attribute gives the
magnitude of the atom's dipole moment.

The {radius} and {diameter} attributes are specific to spherical
particles that have a finite size, such as those defined with an atom
style of {sphere}.

The {omegax}, {omegay}, and {omegaz} attributes are specific to
finite-size spherical particles that have an angular velocity.  Only
certain atom styles, such as {sphere} define this quantity.

The {angmomx}, {angmomy}, and {angmomz} attributes are specific to
finite-size aspherical particles that have an angular momentum.  Only
the {ellipsoid} atom style defines this quantity.

The {tqx}, {tqy}, {tqz} attributes are for finite-size particles that
can sustain a rotational torque due to interactions with other
particles.

The {c_ID} and {c_ID\[N\]} attributes allow per-atom vectors or arrays
calculated by a "compute"_compute.html to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script.  See the
"compute"_compute.html command for details.  There are computes for
calculating the per-atom energy, stress, centro-symmetry parameter,
and coordination number of individual atoms.

Note that computes which calculate global or local quantities, as
opposed to per-atom quantities, cannot be output in a dump custom
command.  Instead, global quantities can be output by the
"thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html command, and local quantities
can be output by the dump local command.

If {c_ID} is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the compute is printed.  If {c_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in
the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the compute.

The {f_ID} and {f_ID\[N\]} attributes allow vector or array per-atom
quantities calculated by a "fix"_fix.html to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been
defined previously in the input script.  The "fix
ave/atom"_fix_ave_atom.html command is one that calculates per-atom
quantities.  Since it can time-average per-atom quantities produced by
any "compute"_compute.html, "fix"_fix.html, or atom-style
"variable"_variable.html, this allows those time-averaged results to
be written to a dump file.

If {f_ID} is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the fix is printed.  If {f_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the fix.

The {v_name} attribute allows per-atom vectors calculated by a
"variable"_variable.html to be output.  The name in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that has been
defined previously in the input script.  Only an atom-style variable
can be referenced, since it is the only style that generates per-atom
values.  Variables of style {atom} can reference individual atom
attributes, per-atom atom attributes, thermodynamic keywords, or
invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so
this is a very general means of creating quantities to output to a
dump file.

See "Section_modify"_Section_modify.html of the manual for information
on how to add new compute and fix styles to LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC to calculate
per-atom quantities which could then be output into dump files.
