11.1 Common problems :link(err_1),h4

If two LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC runs do not produce the same answer on different
machines or different numbers of processors, this is typically not a
bug.  In theory you should get identical answers on any number of
processors and on any machine.  In practice, numerical round-off can
cause slight differences and eventual divergence of molecular dynamics
phase space trajectories within a few 100s or few 1000s of timesteps.
However, the statistical properties of the two runs (e.g. average
energy or temperature) should still be the same.

If the "velocity"_velocity.html command is used to set initial atom
velocities, a particular atom can be assigned a different velocity
when the problem is run on a different number of processors or on
different machines.  If this happens, the phase space trajectories of
the two simulations will rapidly diverge.  See the discussion of the
{loop} option in the "velocity"_velocity.html command for details and
options that avoid this issue.

Similarly, the "create_atoms"_create_atoms.html command generates a
lattice of atoms.  For the same physical system, the ordering and
numbering of atoms by atom ID may be different depending on the number
of processors.

Some commands use random number generators which may be setup to
produce different random number streams on each processor and hence
will produce different effects when run on different numbers of
processors.  A commonly-used example is the "fix
langevin"_fix_langevin.html command for thermostatting.

A LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation typically has two stages, setup and run.  Most
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC errors are detected at setup time; others like a bond
stretching too far may not occur until the middle of a run.

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC tries to flag errors and print informative error messages so
you can fix the problem.  Of course, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC cannot figure out your
physics or numerical mistakes, like choosing too big a timestep,
specifying erroneous force field coefficients, or putting 2 atoms on
top of each other!  If you run into errors that LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC doesn't catch
that you think it should flag, please send an email to the
"developers"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html.

If you get an error message about an invalid command in your input
script, you can determine what command is causing the problem by
looking in the log.lammps file or using the "echo command"_echo.html
to see it on the screen.  For a given command, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC expects certain
arguments in a specified order.  If you mess this up, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC will
often flag the error, but it may read a bogus argument and assign a
value that is valid, but not what you wanted.  E.g. trying to read the
string "abc" as an integer value and assigning the associated variable
a value of 0.

Generally, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC will print a message to the screen and logfile and
exit gracefully when it encounters a fatal error.  Sometimes it will
print a WARNING to the screen and logfile and continue on; you can
decide if the WARNING is important or not.  A WARNING message that is
generated in the middle of a run is only printed to the screen, not to
the logfile, to avoid cluttering up thermodynamic output.  If LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC
crashes or hangs without spitting out an error message first then it
could be a bug (see "this section"_#err_2) or one of the following
cases:

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC runs in the available memory a processor allows to be
allocated.  Most reasonable MD runs are compute limited, not memory
limited, so this shouldn't be a bottleneck on most platforms.  Almost
all large memory allocations in the code are done via C-style malloc's
which will generate an error message if you run out of memory.
Smaller chunks of memory are allocated via C++ "new" statements.  If
you are unlucky you could run out of memory just when one of these
small requests is made, in which case the code will crash or hang (in
parallel), since LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC doesn't trap on those errors.

Illegal arithmetic can cause LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC to run slow or crash.  This is
typically due to invalid physics and numerics that your simulation is
computing.  If you see wild thermodynamic values or NaN values in your
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC output, something is wrong with your simulation.  If you
suspect this is happening, it is a good idea to print out
thermodynamic info frequently (e.g. every timestep) via the
"thermo"_thermo.html so you can monitor what is happening.
Visualizing the atom movement is also a good idea to insure your model
is behaving as you expect.

In parallel, one way LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC can hang is due to how different MPI
implementations handle buffering of messages.  If the code hangs
without an error message, it may be that you need to specify an MPI
setting or two (usually via an environment variable) to enable
buffering or boost the sizes of messages that can be buffered.

11.2 Reporting bugs :link(err_2),h4

If you are confident that you have found a bug in LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC, follow these
steps.

Check the "New features and bug
fixes"_http://www.cfdem.com/liggghtsr-version-historyhttp://www.cfdem.com/liggghtsr-version-historyhttp://www.cfdem.com/liggghtsr-version-history section of the "LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC WWW
site"_liws to see if the bug has already been reported or fixed or the
"Unfixed bug"_http://www.cfdem.com/forums/bug-reports-cfdemrcoupling-liggghtsr-and-parscale
to see if a fix is pending.

Check the "forums"_http://www.cfdem.com/forum
to see if it has been discussed before.

If not, please post a bug report describing the problem with
any ideas you have as to what is causing it or where in the code the
problem might be.  The developers will ask for more info if needed,
such as an input script or data files.

The most useful thing you can do to help us fix the bug is to isolate
the problem.  Run it on the smallest number of particles and fewest number
of processors and with the simplest input script that reproduces the
bug and try to identify what command or combination of commands is
causing the problem.

Respectively the LAMMPS bug sections
"bug"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/bug.html,
"unfixed bug"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/unbug.html
and the "mailing list"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/mail.html
 can be checked.

11.3 Error & warning messages :h4,link(err_3)

These are two alphabetic lists of the "ERROR"_#error and
"WARNING"_#warn messages LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC prints out and the reason why.  If the
explanation here is not sufficient, the documentation for the
offending command may help.
Error and warning messages also list the source file and line number
where the error was generated.  For example, this message

ERROR: Illegal velocity command (velocity.cpp:78)

means that line #78 in the file src/velocity.cpp generated the error.
Looking in the source code may help you figure out what went wrong.

Note that error messages from "user-contributed
packages"_Section_start.html#start_3 are not listed here.  If such an
error occurs and is not self-explanatory, you'll need to look in the
source code or contact the author of the package.

Errors: :h4,link(error)

{All mol IDs should be set for fix gcmc group atoms} :dt

The molecule flag is on, yet not all molecule ids in the fix group have
been set to non-zero positive values by the user. This is an error since
all atoms in the fix gcmc group are eligible for deletion, rotation, and

{Out of range atoms - cannot compute MSM} :dt

One or more atoms are attempting to map their charge to a MSM grid point

"neighbor skin distance"_neighbor.html without neighbor lists being
rebuilt and atoms being migrated to new processors.  This also means
you may be missing pairwise interactions that need to be computed.
The solution is to change the re-neighboring criteria via the
"neigh_modify"_neigh_modify command.  The safest settings are "delay 0
every 1 check yes".  Second, it may mean that an atom has moved far
outside a processor's sub-domain or even the entire simulation box.

{Atom with molecule ID = 0 included in compute molecule group} :dt

The group used in a compute command that operates on moleclues
includes atoms with no molecule ID.  This is probably not what you
want. :dd

{Bond/angle/dihedral extent > half of periodic box length} :dt

This is a restriction because LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC can be confused about which image
of an atom in the bonded interaction is the correct one to use.
"Extent" in this context means the maximum end-to-end length of the
bond/angle/dihedral.  LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC computes this by taking the maximum bond
length, multiplying by the number of bonds in the interaction (e.g. 3
for a dihedral) and adding a small amount of stretch. :dd

{Both groups in compute group/group have a net charge; the Kspace boundary correction to energy will be non-zero} :dt

{Charges are set, but coulombic solver is not used} :dt

The atom style supports charge, but this KSpace style does not include
long-range Coulombics. :dd

{Compute cna/atom cutoff may be too large to find ghost atom neighbors} :dt

The neighbor cutoff used may not encompass enough ghost atoms
to perform this operation correctly. :dd

{Computing temperature of portions of rigid bodies} :dt

The group defined by the temperature compute does not encompass all
the atoms in one or more rigid bodies, so the change in
degrees-of-freedom for the atoms in those partial rigid bodies will
not be accounted for. :dd

{Created bonds will not create angles, dihedrals, or impropers} :dt

{Fix bond/swap will ignore defined angles} :dt

See the doc page for fix bond/swap for more info on this
restriction. :dd

{Fix evaporate may delete atom with non-zero molecule ID} :dt

This is probably an error, since you should not delete only one atom
of a molecule. :dd

{Fix move does not update angular momentum} :dt

Atoms store this quantity, but fix move does not (yet) update it. :dd

{Fix move does not update quaternions} :dt

Atoms store this quantity, but fix move does not (yet) update it. :dd

{Fix recenter should come after all other integration fixes} :dt

Other fixes may change the position of the center-of-mass, so
fix recenter should come last. :dd

{Fix shake with rRESPA computes invalid pressures} :dt

This is a known bug in LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC that has not yet been fixed.  If you use
SHAKE with rRESPA and perform a constant volume simulation (e.g. using
fix npt) this only affects the output pressure, not the dynamics of
the simulation.  If you use SHAKE with rRESPA and perform a constant
pressure simulation (e.g. using fix npt) then you will be
equilibrating to the wrong volume. :dd

{Fix srd SRD moves may trigger frequent reneighboring} :dt

This is because the SRD particles may move long distances. :dd

{Fix srd grid size > 1/4 of big particle diameter} :dt

This may cause accuracy problems. :dd

{Fix srd particle moved outside valid domain} :dt

This may indicate a problem with your simulation parameters. :dd

This may cause accuracy problems. :dd

{Fix srd viscosity < 0.0 due to low SRD density} :dt

This may cause accuracy problems. :dd

{Fix thermal/conductivity comes before fix ave/spatial} :dt

The order of these 2 fixes in your input script is such that fix
thermal/conductivity comes first.  If you are using fix ave/spatial to
measure the temperature profile induced by fix viscosity, then this
may cause a glitch in the profile since you are averaging immediately
after swaps have occurred.  Flipping the order of the 2 fixes
typically helps. :dd

{Fix viscosity comes before fix ave/spatial} :dt

The order of these 2 fixes in your input script is such that
fix viscosity comes first.  If you are using fix ave/spatial
to measure the velocity profile induced by fix viscosity, then
this may cause a glitch in the profile since you are averaging
immediately after swaps have occurred.  Flipping the order
of the 2 fixes typically helps. :dd

{For better accuracy use 'pair_modify table 0'} :dt

The user-specified force accuracy cannot be achieved unless the table
feature is disabled by using 'pair_modify table 0'. :dd

{Geometric mixing assumed for 1/r^6 coefficients} :dt

Self-explanatory. :dd

{Group for fix_modify temp != fix group} :dt

The fix_modify command is specifying a temperature computation that
computes a temperature on a different group of atoms than the fix
itself operates on.  This is probably not what you want to do. :dd

{Improper problem: %d %ld %d %d %d %d} :dt

Conformation of the 4 listed improper atoms is extreme; you may want
to check your simulation geometry. :dd

{Inconsistent image flags} :dt

The image flags for a pair on bonded atoms appear to be inconsistent.
Inconsistent means that when the coordinates of the two atoms are
unwrapped using the image flags, the two atoms are far apart.
Specifically they are further apart than half a periodic box length.
Or they are more than a box length apart in a non-periodic dimension.
This is usually due to the initial data file not having correct image
flags for the 2 atoms in a bond that straddles a periodic boundary.
They should be different by 1 in that case.  This is a warning because
inconsistent image flags will not cause problems for dynamics or most
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulations.  However they can cause problems when such atoms
are used with the fix rigid or replicate commands. :dd

{Kspace_modify slab param < 2.0 may cause unphysical behavior} :dt

The kspace_modify slab parameter should be larger to insure periodic
grids padded with empty space do not overlap. :dd

{Less insertions than requested} :dt

Less atom insertions occurred on this timestep due to the fix pour
command than were scheduled.  This is probably because there were too
many overlaps detected. :dd

{Library error in lammps_gather_atoms} :dt

This library function cannot be used if atom IDs are not defined
or are not consecutively numbered. :dd

{Library error in lammps_scatter_atoms} :dt

This library function cannot be used if atom IDs are not defined or
are not consecutively numbered, or if no atom map is defined.  See the
atom_modify command for details about atom maps. :dd

{Lost atoms via change_box: original %ld current %ld} :dt

The command options you have used caused atoms to be lost. :dd

{Lost atoms via displace_atoms: original %ld current %ld} :dt

The command options you have used caused atoms to be lost. :dd

{Lost atoms: original %ld current %ld} :dt

Lost atoms are checked for each time thermo output is done.  See the
thermo_modify lost command for options.  Lost atoms usually indicate
bad dynamics, e.g. atoms have been blown far out of the simulation
box, or moved futher than one processor's sub-domain away before
reneighboring. :dd

{MSM mesh too small, increasing to 2 points in each direction} :dt

{More than one fix rigid} :dt

It is not efficient to use fix rigid more than once. :dd

{Neighbor exclusions used with KSpace solver may give inconsistent Coulombic energies} :dt

This is because excluding specific pair interactions also excludes
them from long-range interactions which may not be the desired effect.
The special_bonds command handles this consistently by insuring
excluded (or weighted) 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 interactions are treated
consistently by both the short-range pair style and the long-range
solver.  This is not done for exclusions of charged atom pairs via the
neigh_modify exclude command. :dd

{New thermo_style command, previous thermo_modify settings will be lost} :dt

If a thermo_style command is used after a thermo_modify command, the
settings changed by the thermo_modify command will be reset to their
default values.  This is because the thermo_modify commmand acts on
the currently defined thermo style, and a thermo_style command creates
a new style. :dd

{No Kspace calculation with verlet/split} :dt

The 2nd partition performs a kspace calculation so the kspace_style
command must be used. :dd

{No fixes defined, atoms won't move} :dt

If you are not using a fix like nve, nvt, npt then atom velocities and
coordinates will not be updated during timestepping. :dd

{No joints between rigid bodies, use fix rigid instead} :dt

The bodies defined by fix poems are not connected by joints.  POEMS
will integrate the body motion, but it would be more efficient to use
fix rigid. :dd

{Not using real units with pair reax} :dt

This is most likely an error, unless you have created your own ReaxFF
parameter file in a different set of units. :dd

{Number of MSM mesh points increased to be a multiple of 2} :dt

MSM requires that the number of grid points in each direction be a multiple
of two and the number of grid points in one or more directions have been
adjusted to meet this requirement. :dd

{OMP_NUM_THREADS environment is not set.} :dt

This environment variable must be set appropriately to use the
USER-OMP pacakge. :dd

{One or more atoms are time integrated more than once} :dt

This is probably an error since you typically do not want to
advance the positions or velocities of an atom more than once
per timestep. :dd

{One or more compute molecules has atoms not in group} :dt

The group used in a compute command that operates on moleclues does
not include all the atoms in some molecules.  This is probably not
what you want. :dd

{Pair dsmc: num_of_collisions > number_of_A} :dt

Collision model in DSMC is breaking down. :dd

{Pair dsmc: num_of_collisions > number_of_B} :dt

Collision model in DSMC is breaking down. :dd

{Particle deposition was unsuccessful} :dt

The fix deposit command was not able to insert as many atoms as
needed.  The requested volume fraction may be too high, or other atoms
may be in the insertion region. :dd

{Reducing PPPM order b/c stencil extends beyond nearest neighbor processor} :dt

This may lead to a larger grid than desired.  See the kspace_modify overlap
command to prevent changing of the PPPM order. :dd

{Reducing PPPMDisp Coulomb order b/c stencil extends beyond neighbor processor.} :dt

This may lead to a larger grid than desired.  See the kspace_modify overlap
command to prevent changing of the PPPM order. :dd

{Reducing PPPMDisp Dispersion order b/c stencil extends beyond neighbor processor} :dt

This may lead to a larger grid than desired.  See the kspace_modify overlap
command to prevent changing of the PPPM order. :dd

{Replacing a fix, but new group != old group} :dt

The ID and style of a fix match for a fix you are changing with a fix
command, but the new group you are specifying does not match the old
group. :dd

{Replicating in a non-periodic dimension} :dt

The parameters for a replicate command will cause a non-periodic
dimension to be replicated; this may cause unwanted behavior. :dd

{Resetting reneighboring criteria during PRD} :dt

A PRD simulation requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0,
every = 1, check = yes.  Since these settings were not in place,
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC changed them and will restore them to their original values
after the PRD simulation. :dd

{Resetting reneighboring criteria during TAD} :dt

A TAD simulation requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0,
every = 1, check = yes.  Since these settings were not in place,
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC changed them and will restore them to their original values
after the PRD simulation. :dd

{Resetting reneighboring criteria during minimization} :dt

Minimization requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0, every =
1, check = yes.  Since these settings were not in place, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC
changed them and will restore them to their original values after the
minimization. :dd

{Restart file used different # of processors} :dt

The restart file was written out by a LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation running on a
different number of processors.  Due to round-off, the trajectories of
your restarted simulation may diverge a little more quickly than if
you ran on the same # of processors. :dd

{Restart file used different 3d processor grid} :dt

The restart file was written out by a LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation running on a
different 3d grid of processors.  Due to round-off, the trajectories
of your restarted simulation may diverge a little more quickly than if
you ran on the same # of processors. :dd

{Restart file used different boundary settings, using restart file values} :dt

Your input script cannot change these restart file settings. :dd

{Restart file used different newton bond setting, using restart file value} :dt

The restart file value will override the setting in the input script. :dd

{Restart file used different newton pair setting, using input script value} :dt

The input script value will override the setting in the restart file. :dd

{Restart file version does not match LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC version} :dt

This may cause problems when reading the restart file. :dd

{Restrain problem: %d %ld %d %d %d %d} :dt

Conformation of the 4 listed dihedral atoms is extreme; you may want
to check your simulation geometry. :dd

{Running PRD with only one replica} :dt

This is allowed, but you will get no parallel speed-up. :dd

{SRD bin shifting turned on due to small lamda} :dt

This is done to try to preserve accuracy. :dd

{SRD bin size for fix srd differs from user request} :dt

Fix SRD had to adjust the bin size to fit the simulation box.  See the
cubic keyword if you want this message to be an error vs warning. :dd

{SRD bins for fix srd are not cubic enough} :dt

The bin shape is not within tolerance of cubic.  See the cubic
keyword if you want this message to be an error vs warning. :dd

{SRD particle %d started inside big particle %d on step %ld bounce %d} :dt

See the inside keyword if you want this message to be an error vs
warning. :dd

{Shake determinant < 0.0} :dt

The determinant of the quadratic equation being solved for a single
cluster specified by the fix shake command is numerically suspect.  LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC
will set it to 0.0 and continue. :dd

{Should not allow rigid bodies to bounce off relecting walls} :dt

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC allows this, but their dynamics are not computed correctly. :dd

{System is not charge neutral, net charge = %g} :dt

The total charge on all atoms on the system is not 0.0, which
is not valid for the long-range Coulombic solvers. :dd

{Table inner cutoff >= outer cutoff} :dt

You specified an inner cutoff for a Coulombic table that is longer
than the global cutoff.  Probably not what you wanted. :dd

{Temperature for MSST is not for group all} :dt

User-assigned temperature to MSST fix does not compute temperature for
all atoms.  Since MSST computes a global pressure, the kinetic energy
contribution from the temperature is assumed to also be for all atoms.
Thus the pressure used by MSST could be inaccurate. :dd

{Temperature for NPT is not for group all} :dt

User-assigned temperature to NPT fix does not compute temperature for
all atoms.  Since NPT computes a global pressure, the kinetic energy
contribution from the temperature is assumed to also be for all atoms.
Thus the pressure used by NPT could be inaccurate. :dd

{Temperature for fix modify is not for group all} :dt

The temperature compute is being used with a pressure calculation
which does operate on group all, so this may be inconsistent. :dd

{Temperature for thermo pressure is not for group all} :dt

User-assigned temperature to thermo via the thermo_modify command does
not compute temperature for all atoms.  Since thermo computes a global
pressure, the kinetic energy contribution from the temperature is
assumed to also be for all atoms.  Thus the pressure printed by thermo
could be inaccurate. :dd

{Too many common neighbors in CNA %d times} :dt

More than the maximum # of neighbors was found multiple times.  This
was unexpected. :dd

{Too many inner timesteps in fix ttm} :dt

Self-explanatory. :dd

{Too many neighbors in CNA for %d atoms} :dt

More than the maximum # of neighbors was found multiple times.  This
was unexpected. :dd

{Triclinic box skew is large} :dt

The displacement in a skewed direction is normally required to be less
than half the box length in that dimension.  E.g. the xy tilt must be
between -half and +half of the x box length.  You have relaxed the
constraint using the box tilt command, but the warning means that a
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation may be inefficient as a result. :dd

{Use special bonds = 0,1,1 with bond style fene} :dt

Most FENE models need this setting for the special_bonds command. :dd

{Use special bonds = 0,1,1 with bond style fene/expand} :dt

Most FENE models need this setting for the special_bonds command. :dd

{Using compute temp/deform with inconsistent fix deform remap option} :dt

Fix nvt/sllod assumes deforming atoms have a velocity profile provided
by "remap v" or "remap none" as a fix deform option. :dd

{Using compute temp/deform with no fix deform defined} :dt

This is probably an error, since it makes little sense to use
compute temp/deform in this case. :dd

{Using fix srd with box deformation but no SRD thermostat} :dt

The deformation will heat the SRD particles so this can
be dangerous. :dd

{Using largest cutoff for buck/long/coul/long} :dt

Self-exlanatory. :dd

{Using largest cutoff for pair_style lj/long/coul/long} :dt

Self-explanatory. :dd

{Using largest cutoff for pair_style lj/long/tip4p/long} :dt

Self-explanatory. :dd

{Using pair tail corrections with nonperiodic system} :dt

This is probably a bogus thing to do, since tail corrections are
computed by integrating the density of a periodic system out to
infinity. :dd
