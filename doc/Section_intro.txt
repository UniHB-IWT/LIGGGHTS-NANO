1.1 What is LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC :link(intro_1),h4

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC is an Open Source Discrete Element Method Particle
Simulation Software.

Core developer and main author:
Christoph Kloss, christoph.kloss@dcs-computing.com

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC is an Open Source Discrete Element Method Particle
Simulation Software, distributed by DCS Computing GmbH, Linz, Austria.
LIGGGHTS (R) and CFDEM(R) are registered trade marks of DCS Computing GmbH,
the producer of the LIGGGHTS (R) software and the CFDEM(R)coupling software
See http://www.cfdem.com/terms-trademark-policy for details.

LIGGGHTS (R) stands for LAMMPS improved for general granular and
granular heat transfer simulations.
LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulator. It is widely
used in the field of Molecular Dynamics. Thanks to physical and
algorithmic analogies, LAMMPS offers basic functionalities for
DEM simulations. LIGGGHTS (R) aims to improve those capability with
the goal to apply it to industrial applications. LIGGGHTSÂ® is currently
used by a variety of research institutions world-wide. A number of Blue
Chip companies in the fields of chemical, consumer goods, pharmaceutical,
agricultural engineering, food production, steel production, mining,
plastics production use LIGGGHTS (R) for improvement of production processes.
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop
machines, but is designed for parallel computers.  It will run on any
parallel machine that compiles C++ and supports the "MPI"_mpi
message-passing library.  This includes distributed- or shared-memory
parallel machines.
LIGGGHTS (R) can model systems with only a few particles up to millions or
billions. LIGGGHTS (R) is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
capabilities, such as new force fields, atom types, boundary
conditions, or diagnostics.  See "Section_modify"_Section_modify.html
for more details.

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the "GNU Public License"_gnu, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.  See "this section"_#intro_4 for a
brief discussion of the open-source philosophy.

LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC VS. LIGGGHTS-PREMIUM :h4

There are 2 flavors of LIGGGHTS. This documentation may refer to
LIGGGHTS as LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC or as LIGGGHTS-PREMIUM, where PREMIUM
is the name of your company or institution

LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC is the version of LIGGGHTS which is available for public
download at this cite. It offers everything a researcher needs to do simulations:
A large model portfolio, performance, and it is easy to understand and extend with
new capabilities. It is periodically updated, and includes all the contributions
from the community.
LIGGGHTS-PREMIUM is a version with additional features for large-scale industrial
application, available for industrial partner companies of CFDEM(R)project from all
around the world, who have spent several million Euros for developing LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC.
The Premium version is made available to industrial partners and customers as part
of a long-term collaboration involving development projects to further strengthen
the model porfolio of CFDEM(R)project.

History :h4

As the sanme implies, some parts of LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC are based on LAMMPS.
LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code designed to
run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).
The primary developers of LAMMPS are Steve Plimpton, Aidan
Thompson, and Paul Crozier.  The LAMMPS WWW Site at
http://lammps.sandia.gov has more information about LAMMPS.
LAMMPS was originally developed under a US Department of Energy CRADA
(Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) between two DOE labs
and 3 companies.

1.2 LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC features :link(intro_2),h4

In the most general sense, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC integrates Newton's equations of
motion for collections of atoms, molecules, or macroscopic particles
that interact via short- or long-range forces with a variety of
initial and/or boundary conditions.  For computational efficiency
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC uses neighbor lists to keep track of nearby particles.  The
lists are optimized for systems with particles that are repulsive at
short distances, so that the local density of particles never becomes
too large.  On parallel machines, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC uses spatial-decomposition
techniques to partition the simulation domain into small 3d
sub-domains, one of which is assigned to each processor.  Processors
communicate and store "ghost" atom information for atoms that border
their sub-domain.


LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC General features :h4

  runs on a single processor or in parallel
  distributed-memory message-passing parallelism (MPI)
  spatial-decomposition of simulation domain for parallelism
