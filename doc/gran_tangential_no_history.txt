gran tangential no_history model :h3

[Syntax:]

tangential no_history \[other model_type/model_name pairs as described "here"_pair_gran.html \] keyword values :pre
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to the end (after all models are specified) :l
  {disableTangentialWhenBonded} values = 'on' or 'off'
    on = if the "cohesion bond"_gran_cohesion_bond.html model is used, then the tangential force is only added if the two particles are not bonded
    of = the normal force is always added if two particles overlap :pre
  {computeDissipatedEnergy} values = 'on' or 'off'
    on = the tangential model saves the dissipated energy for each contact for the
    use in "fix calculate/dissipated_energy"_fix_calculate_dissipated_energy.html
    of = no values are saved :pre

[LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This part of "pair gran"_pair_gran.html and
"fix wall/gran"_fix_wall_gran.html
is not availabe in LAMMPS.

[Description:]

This granular model is based on the general description of granular
force interaction as described in "pair gran"_pair_gran.html.

If this model is chose, then this "tangential overlap" spring force is
NOT calculated / taken into account, i.e. k_t = 0.

The coefficient of friction cof is the upper limit of the tangential force through
the Coulomb criterion Ft = cof*Fn, where Ft and Fn are the tangential spring and normal
force components in the formulas above.

When the "cohesion model bond"_gran_cohesion_bond.html is used the
{disableTangentialWhenBonded} keyword can be used. If this parameter is set to 'on' then
the tangential model will only compute its contribution if the two neighboring particles
do not have an active bond.

[Coarse-graining information:]

Using "coarsegraining"_coarsegraining.html in
combination with this command should lead to
statistically equivalent dynamics in the system.

NOTE: "Coarsegraining"_coarsegraining.html may or 
may not be available in LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC.
