[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of atom quantities to one or more files every N
timesteps. The timesteps on which dump output is written can also
be controlled by a variable; see the "dump_modify
every"_dump_modify_vtk.html command for details.

Only information for atoms in the specified group is dumped.  The
"dump_modify thresh and region"_dump_modify_vtk.html commands can also
alter what atoms are included; see details below.

As described below, the special character "*" and the suffix in the filename
determine the kind of output.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Unless the "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify_vtk.html option
is invoked, the lines of atom information written to dump files
will be in an indeterminate order for each snapshot.
This is even true when running on a single processor,
if the "atom_modify sort"_atom_modify.html option is on, which it is
by default.  In this case atoms are re-ordered periodically during a
simulation, due to spatial sorting.  It is also true when running in
parallel, because data for a single snapshot is collected from
multiple processors, each of which owns a subset of the atoms.

For the {custom/vtk} style, sorting is off by default. See the
"dump_modify"_dump_modify_vtk.html doc page for details.

:line

The dimensions of the simulation box are written to a separate file
for each snapshot (either in legacy VTK or XML format depending on
the format of the main dump file) with the suffix {_boundingBox}
appended to the given dump filename.

For an orthogonal simulation box this information is saved as a
rectilinear grid (legacy .vtk or .vtr XML format).

Triclinic simulation boxes (non-orthogonal) are saved as
hexahedrons in either legacy .vtk or .vtu XML format.

Style {custom/vtk} allows you to specify a list of atom attributes
to be written to the dump file for each atom.  Possible attributes
are listed above.  In contrast to the {custom} style, the attributes
are rearranged to ensure correct ordering of vector components
(except for computes and fixes - these have to be given in the right
order) and duplicate entries are removed.

You cannot specify a quantity that is not defined for a particular
simulation - such as {q} for atom style {bond}, since that atom style
doesn't assign charges.  Dumps occur at the very end of a timestep,
so atom attributes will include effects due to fixes that are applied
during the timestep.  An explanation of the possible dump custom/vtk attributes
is given below. Since position data is required to write VTK files "x y z"
do not have to be specified explicitly.

The VTK format uses a single snapshot of the system per file, thus
a wildcard "*" must be included in the filename, as discussed below.
Otherwise the dump files will get overwritten with the new snapshot
each time.

:line

Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including
timestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if the
minimization converges.  Note that this means a dump will not be
performed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked,
if the current timestep is not a multiple of N.  This behavior can be
changed via the "dump_modify first"_dump_modify_vtk.html command, which
can also be useful if the dump command is invoked after a minimization
ended on an arbitrary timestep.  N can be changed between runs by
using the "dump_modify every"_dump_modify_vtk.html command.
The "dump_modify every"_dump_modify_vtk.html command
also allows a variable to be used to determine the sequence of
timesteps on which dump files are written.  In this mode a dump on the
first timestep of a run will also not be written unless the
"dump_modify first"_dump_modify_vtk.html command is used.

Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, tmp.dump*.vtk becomes tmp.dump0.vtk, tmp.dump10000.vtk,
tmp.dump20000.vtk, etc.  Note that the "dump_modify pad"_dump_modify_vtk.html
command can be used to insure all timestep numbers are the same length
(e.g. 00010), which can make it easier to read a series of dump files
in order with some post-processing tools.

To write the output file in parallel the filename must end with either ".pvtu"
or ".pvtp". If we assume that the filename is "data.pvtu" then one file with
exactly this name is written. This contains the link to the processor data which
is written in "data_X.vtu" files, where X (= 0,...,P-1) is the ID of the
processor that wrote the file. Thus, in order to visualize all the data in
ParaView one would open the "data.pvtu" file. Writing output in a parallel
fashion can be particularly important on distributed HPC clusters and can
significantly reduce runtime.

NOTE: The legacy ".vtk" file type does not support parallel writing.

By default, P = the number of processors meaning one file per
processor, but P can be set to a smaller value via the {nfile} or
{fileper} keywords of the "dump_modify"_dump_modify_vtk.html command.
These options can be the most efficient way of writing out dump files
when running on large numbers of processors.

Note that using the "*" character and parallel file types together can produce a
large number of small dump files!

If {dump_modify binary} is used, the dump file(s) is/are written in binary
format. A binary dump file will be about the same size as a text version, but
will typically write out much faster. Additionally, {dump_modify compressor} can
be used to specify the writing of compressed binary data. Options for
compressors include:

none: No compression
zlib: Zlib compression
lz4: Lz4 compression (VTK >= 8.0 required) :pre

This section explains the atom attributes that can be specified as
part of the {custom/vtk} style.

The {id}, {mol}, {id_multisphere}, {type}, {element}, {mass}, {vx}, {vy}, {vz}, {fx}, {fy},
{fz}, {q} attributes are self-explanatory.

{id} is the atom ID.  {mol} is the molecule ID, included in the data
file for molecular systems. {id_multisphere} is the ID of the multisphere
body that the particle belongs to (if your version supports multisphere). 
{type} is the atom type.  {element} is
typically the chemical name of an element, which you must assign to
each type via the "dump_modify element"_dump_modify_vtk.html command.
More generally, it can be any string you wish to associate with an
atom type.  {mass} is the atom mass.  {vx}, {vy}, {vz}, {fx}, {fy},
{fz}, and {q} are components of atom velocity and force and atomic
charge.

There are several options for outputting atom coordinates.  The {x},
{y}, {z} attributes are used to write atom coordinates "unscaled", in the
appropriate distance "units"_units.html (Angstroms, sigma, etc).
Additionaly, you can use {xs}, {ys}, {zs} if you want to also save the
coordinates "scaled" to the box size, so that each value is 0.0 to 1.0.
If the simulation box is triclinic (tilted), then all atom coords will
still be between 0.0 and 1.0.  Use {xu}, {yu}, {zu} if you want the
coordinates "unwrapped" by the image flags for each atom.
Unwrapped means that if the atom has passed through a periodic boundary
one or more times, the value is printed for what the coordinate would be
if it had not been wrapped back into the periodic box.  Note that using
{xu}, {yu}, {zu} means that the coordinate values may be far outside the
box bounds printed with the snapshot.  Using {xsu}, {ysu}, {zsu} is similar
to using {xu}, {yu}, {zu}, except that the unwrapped coordinates are
scaled by the box size. Atoms that have passed through a periodic boundary
will have the corresponding cooordinate increased or decreased by 1.0.

The image flags can be printed directly using the {ix}, {iy}, {iz}
attributes.  For periodic dimensions, they specify which image of the
simulation box the atom is considered to be in.  An image of 0 means
it is inside the box as defined.  A value of 2 means add 2 box lengths
to get the true value.  A value of -1 means subtract 1 box length to
get the true value.  LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC updates these flags as atoms cross
periodic boundaries during the simulation.

The {mux}, {muy}, {muz} attributes are specific to dipolar systems
defined with an atom style of {dipole}.  They give the orientation of
the atom's point dipole moment.  The {mu} attribute gives the
magnitude of the atom's dipole moment.

The {radius} and {diameter} attributes are specific to spherical
particles that have a finite size, such as those defined with an atom
style of {sphere}. 
For {superquadric} particles these attributes give bounding sphere radius.

The {omegax}, {omegay}, and {omegaz} attributes are specific to
finite-size spherical particles that have an angular velocity.  Only
certain atom styles, such as {sphere} define this quantity.

The {angmomx}, {angmomy}, and {angmomz} attributes are specific to
finite-size aspherical particles that have an angular momentum.  Only
the {ellipsoid} atom style defines this quantity.

The {tqx}, {tqy}, {tqz} attributes are for finite-size particles that
can sustain a rotational torque due to interactions with other
particles.

The {c_ID} and {c_ID\[N\]} attributes allow per-atom vectors or arrays
calculated by a "compute"_compute.html to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script.  See the
"compute"_compute.html command for details.  There are computes for
calculating the per-atom energy, stress, centro-symmetry parameter,
and coordination number of individual atoms.

Note that computes which calculate global or local quantities, as
opposed to per-atom quantities, cannot be output in a dump custom/vtk
command.  Instead, global quantities can be output by the
"thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html command, and local quantities
can be output by the dump local command.

If {c_ID} is used as an attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the compute is printed.  If {c_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in
the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the compute.

The {f_ID} and {f_ID\[N\]} attributes allow vector or array per-atom
quantities calculated by a "fix"_fix.html to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been
defined previously in the input script.  The "fix
ave/atom"_fix_ave_atom.html command is one that calculates per-atom
quantities.  Since it can time-average per-atom quantities produced by
any "compute"_compute.html, "fix"_fix.html, or atom-style
"variable"_variable.html, this allows those time-averaged results to
be written to a dump file.

If {f_ID} is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the fix is printed.  If {f_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the fix.

The {v_name} attribute allows per-atom vectors calculated by a
"variable"_variable.html to be output.  The name in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that has been
defined previously in the input script.  Only an atom-style variable
can be referenced, since it is the only style that generates per-atom
values.  Variables of style {atom} can reference individual atom
attributes, per-atom atom attributes, thermodynamic keywords, or
invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so
this is a very general means of creating quantities to output to a
dump file.

The {shapex, shapey, shapez, blockiness1, blockiness2, quat1, quat2, quat3, quat4} 
attributes are available only for {superquadric} particles and hence require this 
"atom_style"_atom_style.html

See "Section_modify"_Section_modify.html of the manual for information
on how to add new compute and fix styles to LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC to calculate
per-atom quantities which could then be output into dump files.

[Restrictions:]

The {custom/vtk} style does not support writing of gzipped dump files.

To be able to use {custom/vtk}, you have to link to the VTK library,
please adapt your Makefile accordingly. You must compile LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC with the
-DLAMMPS_VTK option - see the "Making LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC"_Section_start.html#start_2
section of the documentation.

The {custom/vtk} dump style neither supports buffering nor custom format strings.

[Related commands:]

"dump"_dump.html, "dump image"_dump_image.html, "dump_modify"_dump_modify.html,
"undump"_undump.html

[Default:]

By default, files are written in ASCII format. If the file extension is not
one of .vtk, .vtp or .vtu, the legacy VTK file format is used.
