The VORONOI package adds a compute voronoi/atom command which
calculates a Voronoi tesselation of the system.

It uses the Voro++ library, available at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++ to
compute the tesselation locally on each processor.  

== Installation of the Voro++ library ==

1.  Download Voro++ at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/download
    which gives instructions for using SVN to check-out the source:
    % svn checkout https://codeforge.lbl.gov/anonscm/voro/trunk

2.  compile Voro++
    % make 

3.  install Voro++ at the default location (/usr/local) 
    % sudo make install

3b. ..or change the PREFIX variable in the config.mk file 
    to a location that is writable by the user i.e.
    PREFIX=/home/maxuser/install/

4.  In the LAMMPS src directory add the VORONOI package
    % make yes-voronoi

4b. if a different PREFIX than the default was used to install Voro++
    update the paths in the src/VORONOI/Makefile.lammps file

5.  Compile LAMMPS (you should know how that works)

== Run tests ==

Run the includes test input file
./lmp_serial < lammps/examples/voronoi/in.vorotest | grep '^TEST_'

The output should conclude with 'TEST_DONE' and every line should 
report an error of 0%.
